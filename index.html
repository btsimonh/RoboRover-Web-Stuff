<h1>MK802ii based RoboRover with PS2 Eyetoy camera.</h1>
<br />
MK802ii 'Android' stick running Gentoo linux.<br />
PIC18F4550 on (http://www.tiertex.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=59&product_id=52).<br />
Based on and heavily influenced by RaspberryTank (see raspberrytank.ianrenton.com).  Thankyou Ian.<br />
<br />
Wowee 'RoboRover' chassis, using original motor driver and IR sensing.<br />
Low level interfacing using modified UBW (http://www.schmalzhaus.com/UBW/), thank you Brian.<br />
The UBW modifications include IR transmit and receive routines acting on multiple ports, giving sensing information which will be used for autonomous running.<br />
High level code compiled and run on the mk802ii; RaspBerry tank inspired.<br />
HTML serving and PHP via Lighttpd.<br />
2 x 1800Mah lipo (from DVD players?) give a good running time.<br />
Battery sense present; next to do is charger hunting.<br />
Pictures by Sony (PS2  Eyetoy camera).<br />
All interfacing through port 80.... <br/>
<br />
<h1>Control interface:</h1>
Bars to top/left/right/bottom of video represent IR sense.<br />
Yellow -> far contact<br/>
Red -> near contact.<br />
IR front is pulsed with high and low power to get range sens options.<br />
<br />
Right sensor is out at the moment.<br />
<br />
Autonomy is not yet implemented.<br />
Control Images are not right.<br />
Be gentle.<br />
<br />
Video is served via Mjpeg-Streamer to port 8080.  But this is accessed through a PHP page which reads the data, and forwards it on to the requester.<br />
Control is done through port 3000, again forwarded by PHP.<br />
